            <h1>The Rock Dove</h1>
            <p>
                The domestic pigeons that share their homes with us in cities are derived from the wild Rock Dove. 
                They have a long and remarkable history with us, since the day Pigeons were domesticated, around 4000-5000 years ago<sup>[1]</sup>.

                    <strong>Eye</strong><br>
                    Their eyesight is much stronger than humans. In Project Sea Hunt, pigeons were able to spot targets in the water faster than humans 84% of the time.
                    The pigeons also spotted 90% of targets, compared to the humans' 38%.<sup>[2]</sup>
                    <br>Have you seen the way pigeons bob their heads as they walk? They are actually moving their heads forward, holding them in place, then walking forward
                    so their body catches up. They do this to stabilize their vision while moving.<sup>[3]</sup> By minimising the time spent with their heads in motion (and therefore with less visual focus), 
                    they can spot things faster and react to them.

                    <strong>Ear</strong><br>
                    (Yes, The ear is actually behind and slightly below the eye)
                    Pigeons are able to hear infrasounds, which are frequencies too low for humans to normally hear. The normal human range is about 20Hz to 20000 Hz.
                    A study found that pigeons were able to hear a frequency as low as 0.05Hz.<sup>[4]</sup>

                    <strong>Brain</strong><br>
                    Pigeons are marveled for their astounding homing ability. Some pigeons have been able to find their way home from 1100 miles/1770 km away<sup>[5]</sup>.
                    It's not quite known how they do this, though. There are many theories - from using the sun, to smell, to hearing, and even through the Earth's magnetic field.
                    <br>What goes on in that little brain is truly an enigma.

            <h1>Pigeons as messengers</h1>
            <p>
                Pigeons have been used as messengers since ancient Rome<sup>[6]</sup>, and carrier pigeons are thought to have been "employed" since 500 B.C, and
                continued to be used up till 2006<sup>[6]</sup>.
                <br><br>In World War 1, a particular carrier pigeon named Cher Ami delivered a message from an isolated American battalion, leading to the battalion of 194 men being
                rescued<sup>[7]</sup>. Cher Ami had sustained gun fire to his body and leg, yet delivered the message despite having lost his eye and leg. He would later perish from his injuries.
                <br>For his service, Cher Ami was posthumously awarded the French Croix de Guerre with Palm, one of the highest military honours in France.<sup>[7]</sup>
            </p>
            <h1>Project Pigeon</h1>
            <p>
                Before radar and electronic missile guidance systems were developed, there was an attempt to use pigeons to guide missiles to their target.
                <br>This project is know as Project Pigeon, and later as Project Orcon (Organic Control).
                <br>Pigeons are great at identifying objects and can be easily trained to search for specific objects. This is what 1 behavioural psychologist sought to weaponise in
                World War 2. The concept was that pigeons would be placed in a nose cone at the front of a missile, and peck at a screen when they saw their target. A system would steer the 
                missile towards where the pigeons pecked.<sup>[8]</sup>
                <br>The project was canceled, then re-visited in 1948 as Project Orcon, before being canceled again in the advent of technological advancements to guidance systems.<sup>[8]</sup>
            </p>
            <h3>Project Sea Hunt</h3>
            <p>
                Similar to Project Pigeon, Sea Hunt sought to use pigeons to search for people stranded at sea. Instead of guiding missiles, however, the pigeons instead guided the humans
                manning the helicopter to the direction of potential survivors.
                <br>The pigeons were successful in training, being able to find targets faster and more often than humans<sup>[2]</sup>. They went on 1 mission where the survivors were
                successfully found, but the 3 pigeons on board the helicopter unfortunately drowned when the helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed<sup>[2]</sup>.
                <br>Later, Project Sea Hunt would be canceled due to budget cuts, "at no fault of the pigeons"<sup>[2]</sup>.

            <h1>The Stoop</h1>
            <p>
                How does the Peregrine reach such high speeds?
                <br>It is not by flapping its wings, but instead by folding its wings close its body to create the ultra-aerodynamic form that helps it pierce through the sky.
                The falcon dives down in this way, known as the stoop, reaching up to 390 km/h. Nearer to its prey, it will opens its wings to slow down.
